#First MVP Pomodoro Technique Mobile Application

#BUSINESS DOCUMENTATION

The first MVP (minimum viable product) for a Pomodoro technique mobile app would likely include the following features:
1.Timer: The most basic feature of a Pomodoro app is a timer that allows users to set a work interval (typically 25 minutes) and a break interval (typically 5 minutes).
2.Start/Stop/Reset buttons: Users should be able to easily start, stop, and reset the timer.
3.Customizable intervals: Allow users to customise the length of the work and break intervals.
4.Notifications: Send notifications to the user when the work interval is finished and when the break interval is finished.
5.Task tracking: Allow users to track the number of completed Pomodoros and the task associated with each one.
6.Simple interface: The app should have a simple and easy-to-use interface that clearly displays the current status of the timer (e.g. "25:00" for 25 minutes remaining).
7.Setting: Allow users to set the number of Pomodoros they want to complete, and break time in between.
8.The ability to change the sound, vibration and notification settings.
9.Multi-Language support.
This is a general idea and based on MVP, it can be further developed.

#TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION

Implementing a Pomodoro technique mobile app using MAUI (Microsoft .NET Multi-platform App UI) and .NET would involve the following steps:
1.Create a new MAUI project in Visual Studio: Start by creating a new MAUI project in Visual Studio. This will create the basic structure of the app, including the main pages and navigation.
2.Add a timer to the app: Use the .NET Timer class to create a timer that counts down from the work interval to zero. Display the remaining time in a label on the main page.
3.Handle user input: Add start, stop, and reset buttons to the main page. Use these buttons to control the timer and change its state (e.g. running, stopped, reset).
4.Customizable intervals: Allow users to customise the length of the work and break intervals by adding input fields on the settings page.
5.Notifications: Use the .NET Notification class to send notifications to the user when the work interval is finished and when the break interval is finished.
6.Task tracking: Use a database (such as SQLite) to track the number of completed Pomodoros and the task associated with each one.
7.Simple interface: Use MAUI's built-in controls, such as the StackLayout and Grid, to create a simple and easy-to-use interface that clearly displays the current status of the timer.
8.Setting: Allow users to set the number of Pomodoros they want to complete, and break time in between. Use a database to store these settings and retrieve them when the app starts.
9.The ability to change the sound, vibration and notification settings.
10.Multi-Language support. This can be achieved by using resource files or creating a database for translations.
To use MAUI, you will need to have the latest version of .NET 5 installed on your development machine. Also, you will need to make sure the target platforms (iOS, Android, and/or macOS) are configured correctly in the project settings.
